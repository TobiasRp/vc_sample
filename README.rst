This is a prototype for stratified sampling using the void-and-cluster algorithm.


Description
===========

Our original void-and-cluster method (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05073) is designed for spatiotemporal scattered data.
Since it is based on density estimation, the curse of dimensionality will be problematic in higher dimensions.
With this prototype I want to explore stratification in higher dimensions.

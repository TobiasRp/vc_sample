This is a prototype for stratified sampling using the void-and-cluster algorithm.


Description
===========

Our void-and-cluster method (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05073) is designed for spatiotemporal scattered data in 2D and 3D.
Since it is inherently based on kernel density estimation, the curse of dimensionality will be problematic in higher dimensions.

With this prototype I want to explore stratification in higher dimensions.

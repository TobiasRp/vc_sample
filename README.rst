This is a prototype for stratified sampling using the void-and-cluster algorithm for higher-dimensional structured data.


Description
===========

In detail, our original void-and-cluster method (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05073) is designed for spatiotemporal scattered data. Since it is based on density estimation, the curse of dimensionality will be problematic in higher dimensions. With this prototype I want to further explore this.
